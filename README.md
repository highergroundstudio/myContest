# myContest Wordpress Contest Plugin
==================================

We are releasing this plugin into the wild with a MIT license upon discontinuing the development of the plugin. Do anything that you want with our code as long as you provide attribution back to Higher Ground Studio and donâ€™t hold us liable. We will merge good forks but will not be actively developing this project anymore.

Take a look at the [myContest Docs](http://highergroundstudio.github.io/myContest/)

If you would like to add this to the Wordpress plugin directory please open a new issue and we will discuss it there.
